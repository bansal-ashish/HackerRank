"""
Python is an interactive language that allows us to execute statements
individually and see their results. In other words, you don't have to write a
full code and compile it before you see the results as in other languages like
C++ and Java.

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:
print "Hello World!"

You can even store the string in a variable and then print it:
my_string = "Hello World!"
print(my_string)

The above code will print Hello World! on your screen. You can try it in the
console below.

P.S. Do try Solve Me First in Python before moving ahead.
